# IPL-Score-Predictor

- This is just another simple yet interesting project which can approximately predict an innings score based on the data from 2008-2017 IPL season.  
- I tried training two models:  
 1. Linear Regression    
 2. Ridge  
- and out of these surprisingly Linear regression was giving more realistic results.    
- Deployed using Flask.  
- Just run app.py and go to localhost to see the results.
